PandoraCosmicSamples
====================
A set of helpful scripts to make the production of sampes for pandora easier!  
**This is the develop branch so beware of things that may not work!**



Getting Started
---------------
Clone this repo from github using
```git clone https://github.com/a-d-smith/PandoraCosmicSamples.git```

cd into `PandoraCosmicSamples`. Then check your user area is okay and setup some environment variables using
```source install/setup_user_area.sh```

Now install LArSoft-v04_36_00_03, and myfiltermodule using
```source install/install_dependencies_part1.sh```

At this point, your terminal is set up for using LArSoft-v04_36_00_03. 
But, the next thing we want to do is install LArSoft-v05_08_00_05 so you will need to end your ssh session on a fermilab machine, 
then log back in again and cd to `PandoraCosmicSamples`
```logout```
